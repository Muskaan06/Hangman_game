# In this project i have created the hangman game using basics of python programming.

ABOUT THE GAME:

In this game we will be asked to guess a random n letter word. 
The player will get 8 guesses.
The program will display a positive message when the word is rightly guessed along with the number of moves left and the alphabets available to the player.
If the word guessed is wrong/not expected, then the program displays a negative message and the number of moves will be decreased by 1 on every wrong guess.
If the player is able to guess the word within 8 guesses, they win!


ps3_hangman.py file contains the desired code.
words.txt file contains all the words for the game.
